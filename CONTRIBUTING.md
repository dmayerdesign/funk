# How To Contribute

Contributing is simple, because Funk is simple.

(Note that Funk is a work in progress. It is not yet fully functional. There are lots of big holes
that need to be filled! â€” Danny)

**1. Grab an [issue](https://github.com/dmayerdesign/funk/issues) or create your own.**

**2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository.**

**3. Change a test file (ending in `.feature`, `.spec.ts`, or `.steps.ts`), or create your own.**

Feature files are written in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference) and implemented with
[Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Cypress](https://cypress.io).

**4. Write unit tests and API integration tests as necessary.**

API integration tests live in `api/*/spec`. Unit tests live alongside the files they test.

**5. Commit your changes.**

Create a branch named like this: `your-github-username/description-of-your-changes`.

Commit messages should be written in the style of
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

**6. Submit a pull request.**

## Testing Philosophy

A test is 3 things: a design tool, a quality assurance tool, and a form of documentation.

All production code should be covered by tests, because we need all of those characteristics in
order to write code at scale.

## Rules For Testing

1. Write or alter an integration test for any change to production code.
2. Cover all changed or added production code with a test.

## Testing Manually

See [CONFIGURING](./CONFIGURING.md).

## The Development Experience

**It all boils down to simplicity.**

A simple thing is easier to understand, change, extend, and debug. We want Funk to be simple.

But how do you simplify something inherently complex like an e-commerce app?

You might say "just follow the SOLID principles." You'd be mostly right.

But a project can follow the SOLID principles and still feel much more complex than it
should. Members of a team will also usually have varying ways of applying the SOLID
principles.

The obvious answer is for everyone working on a project to
**follow a set of simple rules** that specify how to apply the SOLID principles when writing code.
What exactly those rules are is much less important than
**making sure that they're followed consistently.** What _is_ important about the rules themselves
is that they be **simple enough** to be easily and consistently followed by anyone touching the
code.

Domain-driven design offers such a set of relatively simple rules. Partially due to the full-stack
nature of Funk, it takes a different approach to hopefully achieve the same result: a project that
is easy to change, test, and extend.

Here's the small set of rules that Funk aims to follow:

- **Files containing logic should export only one function.**
  - Benefits I've observed:
    - Keeps tests small and readable.
    - Surfaces architectural boundaries.
    - Maximizes modularity.
    - Forces code to be more organized.
- **Third-party code, including frameworks, should be imported in as few files as**
  **possible.**
  - Benefits I've observed:
    - Framework independence.
    - Makes testing easier.
- **[Behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) should be practiced.**
  - Benefits I've observed:
    - Centers testing and results in high test coverage.
    - Promotes a full top-down understanding of the software.
