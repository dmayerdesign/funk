# Funk

Functional, serverless progressive web app written with Angular to run on Google's Cloud
Firestore and Cloud Functions.

## Design goals

- **Cost-effectiveness:** Funk aims to read and write data from Cloud Firestore
as efficiently as possible.
- **Performance:** Offline support and pre-rendering make sure users get a fast, modern
experience.
- **Developer experience:** Under the hood, Funk is written to reduce boilerplate and
allow developers to write maintainable, performant code.
