# Funk

ðŸŽ¸ Funk provides clean abstractions and simple build tools designed to keep messy details
away from your groove. It sits on top of [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/),
[Angular](https://angular.io), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) so it can
easily be deployed as a cross-platform (browser, mobile and desktop) application.

## Using Funk

To use Funk, fork this repo and follow the instructions in
[Implementation](./IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Design Goals

- **Zero to app in 30 minutes:** Funk aims to lower the barrier of entry for full-stack
  development, allowing me to deploy a production-ready app in almost no time.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Costly behaviors like reads and writes from Firestore should
  perform as efficiently as possible out of the box.
- **Performance:** Offline support and pre-rendering make sure users get a fast, modern
  experience.
- **Developer experience:** Using Funk should be dead simple. To help achieve this, Funk
  strives for convention over configuration, which keeps us from wasting time deciding
  between different ways of doing the same things.
- **Framework independence:** Funk will always rely heavily on frameworks like Ionic and
  technologies like Firebase to do the heavy lifting, but Funk will always treat these
  libraries as plugins. That means that in the future, will be possible to integrate with,
  for example, a cloud platform other than Firebase.

## What's ["Serverless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)?

Managing a server and database â€” even if that means combining managed solutions for
each â€” gives me, a front-end developer, far more control (and opportunity to mess up) than
I want. A fully-managed back end, like Firebase, takes care of all my web server
infrastructure, so I can focus on writing code.

## What's "Cross-Platform"?

Funk uses the amazing cross-platform framework [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), which
allows it to be deployed as a website, an iOS app, and an Android app, all from the same
codebase. Funk uses [Angular](https://angular.io) as a sort of convenience layer on top of
Ionic's amazing component library, giving the developer an excellent suite of build tools
and a framework for writing user interface logic.

## Philosophy

The philosophy underlying Funk is simple: what we're trying to do as developers is
**build [clean](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) software**.
The overarching goal of Funk is to make the pursuit of clean code **easier** and
**more fun**.
